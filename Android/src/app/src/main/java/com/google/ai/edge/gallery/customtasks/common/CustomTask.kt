/**
 * A CustomTask is a user-defined task that can be dynamically added to the app.
 *
 * The user journey for a custom task begins on the home screen, which is organized into categories.
 * These categories correspond to the tabs in the main navigation. Within each category, a list of
 * tasks is displayed. A task represents a specific functionality or use case, and it includes
 * metadata like a label, description, and icon, which are all defined in the `task` property of
 * your `CustomTask` implementation.
 *
 * When a user selects a task on the home screen, they are taken to the task's detail screen. This
 * screen displays the task's description and presents a list of associated models. A single task
 * can have multiple models, allowing the user to choose between different implementations or
 * versions (e.g., different LLM models for a "Chat" task). The user can then select and run a
 * specific model for the task.
 *
 * To create your own custom task, follow these steps:
 * 1. Create a class that implements this `CustomTask` interface.
 * 2. Define the metadata for your task in the `task` property, including its label, description,
 *    and associated models.
 * 3. Implement the `initializeModelFn` and `cleanUpModelFn` functions to handle the setup and
 *    teardown logic for your task's models.
 * 4. Implement the `MainScreen` composable to define the UI for your task's model detail screen.
 *    This is where the user will interact with the model within your task. It's important to note
 *    that this UI will be placed inside a pre-configured `Scaffold` that already handles the app
 *    bar, *which includes the model name, a model selector, and a configuration button. Your focus
 *    here should be on building the main content area of the screen.
 * 5. Create a Hilt module and use `@Provides` and `@IntoSet` to bind your custom task
 *    implementation into a set of `CustomTask`s. This makes your task automatically discoverable by
 *    the app's home screen.
 *
 * For a concrete example of how to implement these steps, see the
 * [com.google.ai.edge.gallery.customtasks.examplecustomtask.ExampleCustomTask] class. This example
 * implements a "Model Viewer" task that displays the text content of a model file for demonstration
 * purpose. See comments there for more details.
 *
