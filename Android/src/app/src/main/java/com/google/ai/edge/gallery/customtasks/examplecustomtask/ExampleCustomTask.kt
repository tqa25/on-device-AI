/**
 * An example implementation of a `CustomTask` that demonstrates how to display the content of a
 * text-based model file.
 *
 * This class provides two primary examples of how to configure models:
 * 1. A "Local model" that expects a file (`model.txt`) to be manually pushed to the device. The
 *    `localFileRelativeDirPathOverride` field is used to specify this behavior.
 * 2. A "Remote model" that downloads a file (`README.md`) from a URL. The `url` and
 *    `downloadFileName` fields are used for this configuration.
 *
 * It showcases the following key functionalities:
 * - Task Definition: The `task` property defines the task's metadata, including its name ("Model
 *   Viewer"), category, description, and the list of models it supports.
 * - Model Initialization: The `initializeModelFn` function shows how to read the content of the
 *   model file (either local or downloaded) and store it in a custom
 *   `ExampleCustomTaskModelInstance`. It also demonstrates how to access model-specific
 *   configurations, such as `maxCharCount`, which can be updated by the user.
 * - Model Cleanup: The `cleanUpModelFn` function is a simple example of how to release resources by
 *   nullifying the model instance.
 * - UI Integration: The `MainScreen` composable provides the UI for the task, displaying the
 *   model's content. It uses a `ViewModel` to manage UI state, such as text color, and reacts to
 *   changes in model configurations, like font size.
